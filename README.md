# HR_Tree_Height_Of_Binary_Tree
Initialize project HR - Tree Height of Binary Tree

This program is a solution to HackerRank problem Tree Height of Binary Tree.

The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and
its furthest leaf. This means that a tree containing a single node has a height
of 0.

The first input will be the number of node values to be expected. The following
integer values will be the tree node values to create. Pass the chain of
tree node to the height method to find the height of the Binary Tree and
return the single integer value of the height as the output

Note: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of each parent
node's left child is less than the value the parent node, and the value of the
parent node is less than the value of its right child.
